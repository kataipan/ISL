1.
(a) - Better: A more flexible model can fit the high number of n better, while the low number of predictors makes overfitting less likely.

(b) - Worse: The reverse of (a), where the low n makes if more likely that the model is fit to noise contained in the data.

(c) - Better: A simpler model would not be able to fit to the more complex relationship of the data

(d) - Worse: More flexible models have higher variance and this would overfit to the noise.

(a) - Regression: We are interested in a potentially infinitely finely graded numerical value (CEO salary), which is better answered in a regression task.
      Inference: We want to understand the relationship between predictor variables and salary.
      n --> 500 firms
      p --> profit, #empolyees, industry

(b) - Classification: We have two conditions, success and failure, and want to classify our new porduct based on the previous products.
      Prediction: We want to estimate how our new product fares
      n --> 20 products
      p --> price, marketing budget, competition price + 10 others

(c) - Regression: Again, we are interested in numerical results.
      Prediction
      n --> weekly data of 2012
      p --> % change in US, UK and DE markets
